### What are the parameters to take into account before adding a new library to the project?

- Size of the library as this might influence the performance of the product.

- An Active Community, as the larger and more active the community is, the better the code and the support you can get if you run into trouble.

- Maintainablity, how often does the library get minor/major releases, how well/often do the maintainers respond to github issues.

- Documentation: Proper documentation is an indicator for the kind of quality and support you can expect from the community.

- Testing: A well tested library is more reliable

- Licensing

- Known Vulnerabilities

- Is it supported by a “big” community and/or a private company?

### Choose one component from CheapTickets.nl and explain what information do you need in order to be able to implement that component.

Slot widget Component:

To implement this component, I will need:
 - an interface that describes what the response from the backend for a fare would look like,
 - a link to the design file(figma, invision etc.)
 - svg icons used on the components (might be downloadable from the design file)
 - clarity on how the component would look on different devices
 - clarity on if the component might be re-used to just display images and not fare infos.
