# Travix Front-End Tech Assignment #01

The aim of the test is to develop a mini-application for managing TODO tasks. 
Using your application we must be able to create tasks and update an existing task. (Deleting a task is optional.)

A really simple server has been implemented with Express. It offers the minimum of expected functionalities 
(get the list of tasks, update a task, delete a task). However, this server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well.

Your mission is to develop the front-end from scratch using react framework. We are also expecting from you a usable, responsive UI.
